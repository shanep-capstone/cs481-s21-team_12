The pavement inspection vehicle project will detect the cracks in the road. A vehicle is fitted with a camera at a higher level 
so that it can have a larger scope of the road. The hardware on board the vehicle is capable of running a real time object detection 
program. This program will be using YOLOv4 for object detection. There is already some work done on it. We will be updating the current 
state of features. We will be adding multi-classification abilities to the program. The instructor has provided us with images of cracks
on the road. The model will be trained on images which don't have the classes labelled. We will be writing a program to label the images. 
This needs to be done so that the model can be trained on a multi class dataset. We will establish a baseline score from the current model's 
score. Then we can fine tune the hyperparameters of the model to increase the performance. We also want to implement a new way of labelling 
the cracks so that they are better segmented. Currently, they are labelled by surrounding the cracks in a box. We want to label the cracks by 
surrounding them in a box which is close to the shape of the crack.
