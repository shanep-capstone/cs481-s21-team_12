# Meeting 0

During this initial period I have met with my sole partner Rohit and we have completed the setup required for us to begin work on our project outside of
choosing which project we'll be working on. Over the course of our first two setup meetings, Rohit and I went through and made the contract together. 
I added our names to the contributors file and we decdied upon using the mit liscense since it is general use which I addded to our liscense file. 
We also came up with a few ideas for what our project may be including but not limited to the following: 
- Spam Filtering
- Black Ice Detector
- Chrome Calendar plug-in

My tasks for this week:
- Decide on the project we'll be working on with Rohit
- Help begin the project epic
- Format anything on the GitHub page that still needs to be
