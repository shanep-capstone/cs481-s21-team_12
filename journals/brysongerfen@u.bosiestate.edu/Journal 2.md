# Journal 2

We have decided to take up one of the sponsored projects that being the autonomous vehicle concrete detection. We have met with our 
advisor for this project, Dr. Yang, and have decided on what ways we would like to improve the concrete detection software. We plan 
on making the box that surrounds the cracks to be more accurate and true to the crack's shape/size and we would like to be able to
classify the cracks into different categories based on size among other factors. We wrote all of this down in our README as was 
required for the project brainstorm. I skimmed through the data and references that Dr. Yang provided us with after our meeting
as well.

# My tasks for this week:
- Read up on what is/how to use YoloV4 
- Look through the reference material more deeply that Dr. Yang provided us with
- Work on the hello world program for the tech lab
- Help write up the review for the frameworks (which will just be YoloV4
