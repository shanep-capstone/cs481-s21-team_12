# Journal 3

This week has just been reading through the references provided by Dr. Yang and learning more about YOLOv4 and the Donkey
Car. I managed to get in contact with him today asking for the existsing code which is when he informed us that
the code they are using comes from the Donkey Car repo which is sourced in one of the posters he provided us with. Besides
reading through the references and data, Rohit and I unfortuanetly haven't been able to do too much this week but have still
kept in close contact and are now ready to move forward.

## Tasks for next week

- Clone the Donkey Car repo so we can get a handle on what already exists for this project.
- Use that repo to complete the tech and build labs
