# Journal 4

Our progress has largely been halted until we are able to hopefully get the existing code from Dr. Lu. We 
will be meeting with him tomorrow along with Professor Panter to discuss our communication problems and get
the issues resolved. So far, we've onyl been provided images and papers and the two repos Dr. Lu did send us
weren't exactly what we were expecting to get. If everything goes well, we should be able to get caught up this 
weekend and back on track for the rest of the semester. Until the meeting however, there isn't really anything we 
can do.

## Tasks for next week

- Hopefully finish the assignments we are behind on
- Get the test lab done
