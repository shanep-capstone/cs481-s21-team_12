# Journal 6

YoloV5 is compiling just fine and all its test programs work. I have imported the raw images provided by Dr. Lu into the
data directory so we are ready to start implementing features. Before that however, we still need to gain access to the
semantic segmentation repo that Dr. Lu sent us or use some other similar repo. I am still slightly confused why we are having
to do redo work that Dr. Lu and his team have already assumedly done but hopefully it won't take too long to get to that point and
begin implementing our features. Dr. Lu just sent us several alternatives to use so we will have to choose one of those to use.

## Tasks for next week

- Choose which semantic segmentation repo to use
- Make sure everything compiles and works ok
- Train our YoloV5 to detect the cracks in concrete
