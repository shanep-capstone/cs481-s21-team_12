# Journal 7

We have chosen which semantic segmentation repo to use and can start re-training the images through that and 
YoloV5. Once we have finished doing that, we can start implementing our features for the last couple weeks of 
the semester and get ready to present our project. It seems like we are on a good track now as the workload
we have for the rest of the semester seems pretty manageable as long as we can figure out how to use 
the existing repos and make them work as we want them to.

## Tasks for next week

- Retrain the images both with YoloV5 and the semantic segmentation repo
- Make sure they are detecting the cracks properly
