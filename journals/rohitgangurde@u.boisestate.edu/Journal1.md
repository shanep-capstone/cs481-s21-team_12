This was the first meeting for our team. Me and my partner, Bryson, met and discussed what we each expected out of this class and completed the team contract. We then talked about what projects we wanted to do and which domain of CS interests us the most. We came up with three projects for now :

- Spam Filtering
- Black Ice Detector
- Chrome Calendar plug in

- I will set up the story board and manage features and stories
- Note down hardware and software requirements for the project
