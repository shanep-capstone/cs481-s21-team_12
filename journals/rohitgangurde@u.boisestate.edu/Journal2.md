# Journal #2
*****

In the past week we decided on our project. We have chosen one of the sponsored projects, Automated Vehicle Pavement Detection.
We met with Dr. Lang Yu who is overlooking the project and discussed about the current state of the project and what improvements 
can be made further. We talked about implementing multi-class crack detection and how that can be achieved. We also talked about a 
better way to label detected cracks so that it's not only just a box around the box, but a more segmented box which is closer to the 
crack's shape. I then created a shared google drive where Dr. Lu can share resources such as data and literature. We also talked about 
having testing code ready by mid March. 

## Tasks for next week :

- Skim thrrough the literature provided by Dr. Lu
- Get familiarised with donkey car software
- Get familiarised with YOLOv4 model
- Work on the hello world program for the tech lab
