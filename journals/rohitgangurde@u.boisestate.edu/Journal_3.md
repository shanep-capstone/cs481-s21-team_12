# Journal 3

For the past week, I read up on the literature for donkey car 
and YOLOv4. After meeting with Dr. Lu, I created a shared drive 
in which Dr. Lu uploaded the materials related to the project. 
He uploaded quite a few papers on YOLOv4 and work done in the 
field of crack detection. He also posted the most important part 
of any modern deep learning task, **the data!** He uploaded a big 
zip folder which contained images to be used in training the model.
Dr. Lu didn't provide us with any code that he or his team has worked 
on. He has pointed us to a git repo, Donkey Car, and said that is the 
code they are using. So I am still unsure about how to proceed. 

## Tasks for next week :

- Clone Donkey Car repo and play with it to get an idea about the code 
  and any specific frameworks and libraries being used. 

- Figure out how to build our project.
