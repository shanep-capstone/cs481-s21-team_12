# Journal 4


We are stuck in terms of progress. Unable to get our 
hands on the code, there isn't much we can do. With 
the meeting tomorrow everything should be back on track. 
I went on a mini vacation this past weekend so there is 
still a bit of vacation left in me leading to procrastination. 
But hopefully after tomorrow, everything gets back to normal. 

# Tasks for the week

 - Attend the meeting tomorrow and clarify everything. 
 - Go through the code ( assuming after tomorrow we get it )
 - Get done with assigned labs.
