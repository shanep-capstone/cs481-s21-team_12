# Journal 4 

This past week has been completing exams. After the last meeting, I have a better understanding about what we need to do.
We need to essentially add a new feature to an existing SDK. The first step will be to set up the dependencies and get things 
running on our systems. I had YOLOv4 running on my previous system but not my current one. So it should be a bit easy,
hopefully. We still need to get permission for the other repo, so waiting on the author's of the code to reply to our 
request. 

# Tasks for the week

- Get dependencies setup
- Follow up on code request
