# Journal 6

So we still haven't gained access to the repo that 
Dr. Lu pointed us towards. He has however provided 
alternatives now. So that should help us get on with 
our project. There are many hiccups that came so far 
but let's hope for a smoother sailing for this point 
onwards. I got my ankle snapped and my AC joint on my 
shoulder might be dislocated (still haven't done a 
X-ray). Not a great week for me. 

# Things to do

 - Pick one of the repo that Dr. Lu sent
 - Start with the setting up the repo
